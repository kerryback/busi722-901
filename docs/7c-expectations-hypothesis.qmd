## Forward Curve
    
- The forward curve shows the prices of contracts for different delivery dates.
    
- It shifts up and down over time as prices change.
    
- Its slope can also change.  

- The front month price is the "spot price" - i.e., the price for (near) immediate delivery.

## Expectations hypothesis

- The expectations hypothesis is: The futures price is equal to the market's expectation of what the spot price will become.
- Example: maybe the market expected on 1-24-2022 that gold would hit $2,000 by the end of 2027.
- The expectations hypothesis is reasonable, though there is risk and there may be risk premia.

## Expectations and the forward curve

- Expectations affect not just the futures price but also today's spot price.
- Example: If we think gold will hit $2,000 in 6 years and it is trading at $500 today, then we should all be buying gold today (quadruple our money in 6 years).
- This drives up the spot price to the point that we would only get a "normal" return on spot gold.

##

- Ignoring risk and risk premia, if we think gold will hit $2,000 in 6 years, then today's spot price should be $\text{2,000} / (1+r)^6$.

. . .

$$\text{spot}\! =\! \frac{\text{futures}}{(1+r)^6} \; \Leftrightarrow \; \text{futures} \!=\! \text{spot}\! \times\! (1+r)^6$$

- In fact, futures should be higher by $1+r$ each year.

## Contango

- A market is in contango if the forward curve is upward sloping, as in the gold example.

- In other words, you pay more for future delivery than in the spot market.

- The term originates from deferring purchase of a stock.  You had to pay a fee to postpone settlement.

- Contango is natural, because of the time value of money.  But, there are other factors.
    


## Backwardation

- A market is in backwardation in the opposite situation: the forward curve is downward sloping.

df = pd.read_sql(" select * from data where code like 'CME_ES%' and date='2016-01-22' ", conn)    
df['expiry'] = df.code.apply(expiry)
df = df.sort_values(by='expiry').set_index('expiry')
trace = go.Scatter(
    x=df.index.to_list(),
    y=df.settle,
    mode="lines",
    hovertemplate="expiration = %{x}<br>futures price = $%{y:,.2f}<extra></extra>"
)

fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(trace)
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Expiration",
    yaxis_title="Futures Price",
    xaxis_title_font = {"size":18},
    template="plotly_white",

```



## Backwardation and Expectations Hypothesis

- According to the expectations hypothesis, the market expected stock prices to fall on 1-22-2016.
- Did people expect to lose money on stocks?
- No.  Part of the stock return is the dividend.  
- If people expect to earn the risk-free rate on stocks as dividends + capital gain and dividends > risk-free rate, then capital gain < 0.


## Summary

- Expectations hypothesis is "futures price = expected future spot price."
- Expectations affect both the futures price and the spot price.
- Markets can be in contango (rising futures price) or backwardation (falling futures price).
