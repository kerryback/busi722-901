# Speculating on currencies

## Currency speculation with futures

- Consider selling currency futures that are in contango
- If forward curve doesn't move, forward roll will produce profits
- Likewise, buying currency futures in backwardation may be profitable
- What may go wrong?
  - Spot may rise for contango futures
  - Spot may fall for backwardation futures

## Currency carry trade

- Borrow in low interest rate currencies
- Invest in high interest rate currencies
- What may go wrong?
  - Low interest-rate currencies may appreciate
  - High interest-rate currencies may depreciate

## Equivalence

- Low interest-rate $\Leftrightarrow$ contango.  Appreciate $\Leftrightarrow$ spot rises
- High interest-rate $\Leftrightarrow$ backwardation.  Depreciate $\Leftrightarrow$ spot falls

## What do the data show?

- Currency carry trade has been profitable on average
- Equivalently, selling contango futures and buying backwardation futures has been profitable on average

# Futures options

## 
    
- A call option on a futures contract gives you the right to acquire a long position in the futures (buy the futures) at the option strike.
    
- A put option gives you the right to acquire a short position in the futures (sell the futures) at the option strike.

- If you've sold an option and it is exercised, you are rolled into the opposite futures position.
  - short futures if you sold a call
  - long futures if you sold a put

##

- On the exercise date of a call, daily settlement produces a cash flow of futures_settlement_price - strike to the party who exercised and the opposite cash flow to the party who sold the call.

- For a put, it is strike - futures_settlement_price.

- Everyone who wants could unwind the futures position by making an offsetting trade on the day of exercise.  

## Risk-neutral probability from before

- If there were no risk premium, the call value would be the expected value discounted at the risk-free rate:

. . .

$$C = \frac{p \times \text{\$}5 + (1-p)\times \text{\$}0}{1.05}$$

- where $p=$ prob of positive return.  

##

- The stock price would also be the discounted expected value:

. . .

$$\text{\$}100 = \frac{p \times \text{\$}110 + (1-p) \times \text{\$}90}{1.05}$$

- - Solve the stock equation for $p$ and substitute into the call option equation.

## Risk-neutral probability for futures options

- The futures price would be the expected (not discounted, because no cash changes hands upon purchase/sale):

. . .

$$\text{\$}100 = p \times \text{\$}110 + (1-p) \times \text{\$}90$$

## Calibrating binomial tree for futures option

- Set $T=$ time to maturity in years of a futures option
- Set $N=$ number of periods in a binomial model
- Set $\Delta t = T/N=$ period length
- Set the up rate of return as $e^{\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}}-1$ and down rate of return as $e^{-\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}} - 1$.

##

- The risk-neutral probability of "up" is

. . .

$$\frac{1 - e^{-\sigma \Delta t}}{e^{\sigma \Delta t} - e^{-\sigma \Delta t}}$$
