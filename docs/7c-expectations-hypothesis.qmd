## Forward Curve
    
- The forward curve shows the prices of contracts for different delivery dates.
    
- It shifts up and down over time as prices change.
    
- Its slope can also change.  

- The front month price is the "spot price" - i.e., the price for (near) immediate delivery.

## Gold Forward Curve

## Expectations hypothesis

- The expectations hypothesis is: The futures price is equal to the market's expectation of what the spot price will become.
- Example: maybe the market expected on 1-24-2022 that gold would hit $2,000 in 8 years.
- The expectations hypothesis is reasonable, though there is risk and there may be risk premia.

## Expectations and the forward curve

- Expectations affect not just the futures price but also today's spot price.
- Example: If we think gold will hit $2,000 in 8 years and it is trading at $500 today, then we should all be buying gold today (quadruple our money in 8 years).
- This drives up the spot price to the point that we would only get a "normal" return on spot gold.

##

- Ignoring risk and risk premia, if we think gold will hit $2,000 in 8 years, then today's spot price should be $\text{2,000} / (1+r)^8$.
- So, futures in 8 years (2,000)should equal spot $\times (1+r)^8$
- In fact, the forward curve should be rising by the factor $1+r$ each year.

## Contango

- A market is in contango if the forward curve is upward sloping, as in the gold example.

- In other words, you pay more for future delivery than in the spot market.

- The term originates from deferring purchase of a stock.  You had to pay a fee to postpone settlement.

- Contango is natural, because of the time value of money.  But, there are other factors.
    


## Backwardation

- A market is in backwardation in the opposite situation: the forward curve is downward sloping.

## Backwardation and Expectations Hypothesis

- According to the expectations hypothesis, the market expected stock prices to fall on 1-24-2022.
- Did people expect to lose money on stocks?
- No.  Part of the stock return is the dividend.  According to the expectations hypothesis, the market expected to earn the risk-free rate on stocks as dividends + capital gain.
- Dividends > interest $\Rightarrow$ capital gain < 0.

## Summary

- Expectations hypothesis is "futures price = expected future spot price."
- Expectations affect both the futures price and the spot price.
- Markets can be in contango (rising futures price and futures > spot) or backwardation (falling futures price and futures < spot).
