    "text": "Kerry Back  kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\n\nMondays, Mar 4 and Mar 18 - Apr 22 8:00 PM Central Time Zoom Link\n\n\n\nWe’ll cover two topics in this course: quantitative equity investing and derivative securities. Quantitative equity investing is using quantifiable signals to select stocks via algorithms. We’ll explore machine learning methods to predict returns and classify stocks as Buy/Hold/Sell. We’ll backtest trading strategies based on the signals. And, we will analyze the results in the way that endowments and other institutions evaluate investment managers. We’ll do a real-world implementation of our algorithms using daily updated company financials and market data from a SQL database and with paper trading via the python API at Alpaca Markets.\nDerivative securities are securities whose values depend upon (are derived from) other securities. We’ll cover options and futures, which are the basic derivative securities. Options and futures are important instruments for risk management and also for investing. We’ll explain what the securities are and how they trade, how they are used in risk management and investments, and how to value them.\n\n\n\nGrades will be based on weekly assignments and a project. They will count equally towards the course grade.\nThe project requires conducting backtests of strategies and implementing a strategy on Alpaca. The strategy that is implemented should be a 150/50 strategy, meaning 150% long and 50% short. Each person should submit a pdf containing the following elements.\n\nDescriptions of at least two strategies\nDescription of the backtest procedure\nEvaluation of backtest results for the two strategies\nExplanation for why one of the strategies was chosen for implementation\nDescription of the trading process: how many stocks and when were trades made\nEvaluation of the weekly returns of the Alpaca strategy (return compared to SPY over the same time period)\n\nThe first trades on Alpaca should be on Friday, April 11. Portfolios should be adjusted based on changes in stock features on April 18, and the portfolio value at that time should be recorded. The portfolio value should be recorded again on April 25. The report should describe the weekly returns from April 11 to 18 and April 18 to 25. The submission is due by midnight on Tuesday, April 29.\n\n\n\nThe Rice University honor code applies to all work in this course. Each student must do his or her own assignments, but it is allowed and in fact encouraged for students to seek advice from each other.\n\n\n\nAny student with a documented disability requiring accommodations in this course is encouraged to contact me outside of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Any adjustments or accommodations regarding assignments or the final exam must be made in advance. Students with disabilities should also contact Disability Support Services in the Allen Center."
