## Arbitrage and spot-futures parity

- In last session, looked at implications of the expectations hypothesis for the forward curve.
- In this session, we look at the implications of arbitrage.
- Question is: how do futures prices relate to spot (contango or backwardation) and why?
- Link between spot and futures is called spot-futures parity.

## Overview of arbitrage

- Suppose the forward curve is extremely steep.  At some point, it pays to buy spot and sell futures.
- Suppose the forward curve is extremely downwards sloping.
  - If you can short sell the spot, you can sell spot and buy futures.  Accept delivery on the futures to cover the short spot position.
  - Or people who are long spot, could sell it and buy futures to restore their long position.

## Synthetic long futures and steep forward curves

- On a long futures (ignoring daily settlement), you pay in the future and accept delivery in the future.
- To duplicate this, you can borrow money, buy spot and hold.
- At the future date, you will have the asset (like accepting delivery) and owe money (like paying in the future).
- If the synthetic futures is cheaper, you should create it and sell the futures contract.

##

- The synthetic futures is cheaper when the futures price is sufficiently high (forward curve is sufficiently steep).
- The possibility of arbitrage rules out extremely steep forward curves.

## Synthetic short futures and downward sloping forward curves

- On a short futures (ignoring daily settlement), you deliver in the future and get paid then.
- To duplicate this, you can short the spot and invest the proceeds in T-bills.
- At the future date, you will owe the asset (like having to deliver) and have cash (like being paid in the future).
- If the synthetic short futures generates more cash, then you should create it and buy the futurex contract.

##

- The synthetic short futures generates more cash when the futures price is sufficiently low (forward curve is sufficiently downward sloping).
- The possibility of arbitrage rules out extremely downward sloping forward curves (when you can short the asset).

## Cost of carry


## Understanding S&P 500 Futures

- Buying stocks ties up money but provides dividends.
- Better to buy spot (at equal prices) if dividends > interest.  This implies backwardation.
- Better to buy futures (at equal prices) if interest > dividends.  This implies contango.
 
## Currency Futures

- The advantage of owning a foreign currency now is that you can invest it and earn the foreign interest rate.
    
- The cost of buying foreign currency now is that it ties up dollars and you lose the dollar interest rate.
    
- Whether it is better to buy now or buy later depends on which interest rate is higher.
    
- U.S. interest rate higher $\Rightarrow$ contango (like gold)
    
- Foreign interest rate higher $\Rightarrow$ backwardation.

## Commodities

- Commodities (energy, agricultural) are sometimes in backwardation and sometimes in contango.

- Backwardation occurs 
  - when there is nothing left in storage to sell now to cause spot prices to come down relative to futures prices.
  - or people are hoarding.  For example, corn (and others) moved into backwardation during the pandemic.

##

- If a commodity is seasonal and storage is costly, futures may have seasonal spikes (e.g., natural gas and gasoline).

## Understanding Gold Futures

- There is lots of gold in storage.  If the futures is less than the spot price, people storing gold should sell spot and buy futures.  
  - They earn the difference between the prices plus interest that they can earn on the cash from selling spot.
- The story is the same if the futures price at a long maturity is less than the futures price at a shorter maturity.  
  - Buy the cheap short maturity and sell the expensive long maturity.  
    
##

- But what everyone thinks the bottom will drop out of the gold market? 

- Then the spot price will drop now.  The futures will still end up higher than the spot.


## Gold futures

- Synthetic gold futures:
  - borrow money, buy gold spot and store it
  - later pay today's spot price + interest and have gold
- Futures price should equal today's spot price + interest
  - Anyone can create synthetic futures and sell actual futures if synthetic futures is cheaper
  - People storing gold can "sell" synthetic futures and buy actual if synthetic is more expensive

## Cost of carry and convenience yield

- Cost of carry = cost of owning physical = foregone interest + storage costs
- Convenience yield = benefit of owning physical = dividends and/or profits from temporary product shortages

## Contango and backwardation

- Contango = upward sloping forward curve (futures > spot)
- Cost of carry > convenience yield $\Rightarrow$ contango (like gold)
- Backwardation = downward sloping (spot > futures)
- Convenience yield > cost of carry $\Rightarrow$ backwardation (like peso)
- Commodities can have high cost of carry (storage) and sometimes high convenience yield
