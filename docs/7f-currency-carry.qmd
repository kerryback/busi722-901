## Exchange rates

- It is simplest to quote foreign currency prices in the domestic currency (dollars).
- Cost of a euro, cost of a peso, etc. is the same concept as the cost of a loaf of bread.
- A currency appreciates (relative to the dollar) when its cost rises and depreciates when its cost falls.

## Currency carry trade

- The currency carry trade is to borrow in a low interest-rate currency (e.g., euro) and invest in a high interest-rate currency (e.g., peso).
- You earn the interest differential.  Interest is called carry.
- The risk is that the high interest-rate currency may depreciate relative to the other.
- Empirically, this has been a profitable trade on average.

## 

- Borrowing in euros, exchanging to pesos, and depositing pesos is shorting euros and going long pesos.
- Example: short (borrow) $100,000 of euros and go long $100,000 of pesos.  Pay euro interest rate and receive peso interest rate.  Earn the difference.
- But when we sell the pesos and cover the euro loan, prices may have moved.

## Currency carry with futures

- Short euros and invest in $ = synthetic short euro future
- Borrow $ and buy pesos = synthetic long peso future 
- Combining them equals currency carry trade ($ cancel)
- Combining actual long peso future and actual short euro future also equals currency carry trade

## Backwardation and contango

- Futures price = spot price + cost of carry - convenience yield
- = spot price + domestic interest - foreign interest
- Low foreign interest $\Rightarrow$ contango (euros)
- High foreign interest $\Rightarrow$ backwardation (peso)
- So, currency carry trade = sell contango futures and buy backwardation futures

## Expensive and cheap futures

- Sell contango futures = sell futures when futures price is high (relative to spot)
- Buy backwardation futures = buy futures when futures price is low (relative to spot)
- So, currency carry trade = sell expensive futures and buy cheap futures (relative to spot)

## Appreciation and returns

- Consider selling 2-month euro (contango) futures and buying 2-month peso (backwardation) futures at date $t$ and holding for 2 months, until futures price = spot
- On peso, make 

. . .

$$\text{peso-spot}_{t+2} - \text{peso-spot}_t$$
$$+ \text{peso-spot}_{t} - \text{peso-futures}_t$$

- This is spot appreciation - forward curve slope

## Failure of expectations hypothesis

- On euro, make opposite.  So, total is difference in slopes (which is positive) + difference in appreciations.
- Expectation hypothesis implies expected difference in appreciations cancels difference in slopes.
- Empirically, average difference in appreciations actually adds a bit to difference in slopes.
  - Peso (backwardation) actually appreciates a little.
  - Euro (contango) actually depreciates a little.
