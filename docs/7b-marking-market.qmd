- If a contract has a negative value to someone (they have a unrealized loss) and the person defaults, then the clearinghouse would have to make good on it.
  
- To avoid this risk, the exchange does daily settlement: all gains and losses are realized daily and then contracts are reset at the daily settlement price -- called `marking to market.'
  

## Example

- Suppose you bought 1 CME WTI contract for Dec, 2022 delivery on Jan 2, 2020.  You bought it at $51.80.  The contract closed (settled) that day at $51.97.
    
- You made $\text{1,000 barrels} \times 0.17 \$/\text{barrel} = \$170$ on Jan 2.  You received that money at the end of the day.

## 

- The settlement prices for subsequent days were
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Jan 3} \quad & \quad 51.72\\
        \text{Jan 6} \quad & \quad  51.81\\
        \text{Jan 7} \quad & \quad 52.13 \\
        \text{Jan 8} \quad & \quad 51.31
    \end{align*}

- Suppose you sold 1 contract on Jan 9 at $51.50.  

##

- Here are the daily cash flows

. . .

\begin{align*}
       \text{Jan 2} \quad & \quad 51.80 & \quad \\
       \text{Jan 2} \quad & \quad 51.97 & \quad +170\\
        \text{Jan 3} \quad & \quad 51.72& \quad - 250\\
        \text{Jan 6} \quad & \quad  51.81& \quad + 90\\
        \text{Jan 7} \quad & \quad 52.13 & \quad +320\\
        \text{Jan 8} \quad & \quad 51.31& \quad - 820\\
        \text{Jan 9} \quad & \quad 51.50& \quad + 190
    \end{align*}

- The net is $-300 = \text{1,000} \times (51.50-51.80)$.

## Cash Settled Contracts
    
- Cash settled contracts are also settled daily.

- On the last day, settlement is based on the spot price.

- E.g., the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is settled on the last day at the actual S&P 500 index level.
