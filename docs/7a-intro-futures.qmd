- A forward contract is a contract to deliver something and to be paid at a later date.
    
- A futures contract is functionally like a forward contract, but it is traded on an exchange with anonymous counterparties and special provisions to deal with default risk.
 
- Primary exchanges are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

- The futures clearinghouse provides guarantees to both sides in case of a failure to deliver.



## Standardization

- Futures contracts are standardized regarding quantity, quality, and delivery.   Standardization improves liquidity.
-  Hedgers are  left with ``basis risk,'' meaning the difference between the standardized contract and what, where, and when they really want.    
- Example: CME/NYMEX WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil contract is for 1,000 barrels to be delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma with restrictions on sulfur, gravity, and other qualities: [CME WTI contract specifications](https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/2/200.pdf).
  



## Examples of Contracts

 
- CME WTI crude: 1,000 barrels delivered to Cushing, OK
- CME natural gas: 10,000 MMBtu delivered to Henry Hub, LA
- CME gasoline: 42,000 gallons delivered to NY harbor
- CME heating oil (ULSD) : 42,000 gallons delivered to NY harbor
- CME gold: 100 troy ounces

##

- CME corn: 5,000 bushels of No. 2 yellow corn at par, No. 1 yellow corn at 1.5 cents per bushel over contract price, or No. 3 yellow corn at between 2 and 4 cents per bushel under contract price depending on broken corn and foreign material and damage grade factors.
- CME Mexican peso: 500,000 pesos
- CME E-mini S\&P 500: $50 multiplier (cash settled)

## Cash Settlement

- There are some futures contracts with no delivery procedures.  They are cash settled.

- Instead of delivery, cash changes hands based on the price at maturity of the underlying asset.
    
- Example: E-mini S\&P 500 futures.  The futures price is an index level (e.g., 4600).  It is determined by supply and demand in the futures market, usually $\neq$ actual S\&P 500 index.


##

- If you buy the E-mini S\&P 500 futures contract and S&P index at maturity > futures price at which you bought, you make money.

- You make $50 times the difference between the index at maturity and the futures price.

- $50 is the "contract size."

## Front Month Contract

- Contracts are traded for delivery at monthly intervals.
- When you hear that ``oil is up 2\%,'' this almost certainly refers to the futures contract that is nearest to maturity (the shortest contract), called the front month contract.
    
- Contracts at different maturities are highly correlated, so other contracts are probably also up, but near-maturity contracts tend to be more volatile, so other contracts are probably up by less than 2\%.




## Margin

- The buyer does not pay the seller when a futures contract is traded.
- Both have to post collateral (margin) to ensure they can uphold their future obligations.  Generally less than 10\% of the contract value.

## Exiting through trade

- Positions are usually cancelled by making offsetting trades.
- Example: buy a contract at $70.  Later sell when price is at $80.  Made $10 per unit.  Would need margin around $7 for this trade.
